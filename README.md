Book Recommendation System
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Book Recommendation System using the Book-Crossing dataset.
It covers the complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering
Model Building using multiple ML algorithms
Model Evaluation & Comparison
Deployment of the final recommendation system

The goal is to recommend books to users based on their preferences and past ratings.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy (Data preprocessing, EDA)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
Scikit-learn (ML algorithms, evaluation)
Recommender libraries (for collaborative filtering)
Streamlit (Deployment)

Project Workflow
Data Understanding & Cleaning
Analyzed users, books, and ratings dataset
Handled missing values, duplicates, and anomalies
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized rating distributions, user activity, and book popularity
Derived insights about user preferences

Feature Engineering
Prepared user-book matrices
Encoded categorical features

Model Building
Implemented multiple ML algorithms:
Collaborative Filtering
Content-Based Filtering
Hybrid Models

Evaluation
Compared models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall

Deployment
Built a simple web app for recommending books
Users can input their ID or preferences to get recommendations
